["the company has, say, 6 months of runway",
"or to put it more brutally, 6 months before they're out of business",
"they expect to avoid that by raising more from investors",
"that last sentence is the fatal one",
"it's hard to convince investors the first time too, but founders expect that",
"what bites them the second time is a confluence of three forces:",
"the company is spending more now than it did the first time it raised money",
"investors have much higher standards for companies that have already raised money",
"the company is now starting to read as a failure",
"the first time it raised money, it was neither a success nor a failure; it was too early to ask",
"i'm going to call the situation i described in the first paragraph \"the fatal pinch",
"one of the things that makes the fatal pinch so dangerous is that it's self-reinforcing",
"y combinator tells founders who raise money to act as if it's the last they'll ever get",
"i will now, by an amazing feat of clairvoyance, do this for you: the probability is zero",
"you should shut down the company if you're certain it will fail no matter what you do",
"companies rarely have to fail though",
"what i'm really doing here is giving you the option of admitting you've already given up",
"if you don't want to shut down the company, that leaves increasing revenues and decreasing expenses",
"in most startups, expenses  people and decreasing expenses  firing people",
"if so, now's the time",
"which leaves two options, firing good people and making more money",
"you should lean more toward firing people if the source of your trouble is overhiring",
"plus those 15 people might not even be the ones you need for whatever you end up building",
"so the solution may be to shrink and then figure out what direction to grow in",
"it may seem facile to suggest a startup make more money, as if that could be done for the asking",
"usually a startup is already trying as hard as it can to sell whatever it sells",
"but only work on whatever will get you the most revenue the soonest",
"or you may have expertise in some new field they don't understand",
"and to the extent you can, try to avoid the worst pitfalls of consulting",
"you keep the ip and no billing by the hour",
"you just have to realize in time that you're near death",
"and if you're in the fatal pinch, you are",
"it struck me recently how few of the most successful people i know are mean",
"there are exceptions, but remarkably few",
"meanness isn't rare",
"in fact, one of the things the internet has shown us is how mean people can be",
"a few decades ago, only famous people and professional writers got to publish their opinions",
"now everyone can, and we can all see the long tail of meanness that had previously been hidden",
"what's going on here? are meanness and success inversely correlated?",
"part of what's going on, of course, is selection bias",
"i only know people who work in certain fields: startup founders, programmers, professors",
"i'm willing to believe that successful people in other fields are mean",
"maybe successful hedge fund managers are mean; i don't know enough to say",
"it seems quite likely that most successful drug lords are mean",
"being married to her is like standing next to an airport baggage scanner",
"why? i think there are several reasons",
"one is that being mean makes you stupid",
"that's why i hate fights",
"you never do your best work in a fight, because fights are not sufficiently general",
"winning is always a function of the situation and the people involved",
"and yet fighting is just as much work as thinking about real problems",
"startups don't win by attacking",
"they win by transcending",
"there are exceptions of course, but usually the way to win is to race ahead, not to stop and fight",
"another reason mean founders lose is that they can't get the best people to work for them",
"they can hire people who will put up with them because they need a job",
"but the best people have other options",
"a mean person can't convince the best people to work for him unless he is super convincing",
"and while having the best people helps any organization, it's critical for startups",
"the startup founders who end up richest are not the ones driven by money",
"[1] the ones who keep going are driven by something else",
"they may not say so explicitly, but they're usually trying to improve the world",
"which means people with a desire to improve the world have a natural advantage",
"this kind of work is the future",
"for most of history success meant control of scarce resources",
"for most of history, success meant success at zero-sum games",
"and in most of them meanness was not a handicap but probably an advantage",
"that is changing",
"increasingly the games that matter are not zero-sum",
"there have long been games where you won by having new ideas",
"in the third century bc archimedes won by doing that",
"at least until an invading roman army killed him",
"and not just not being at war",

"jessica and i have always worked hard to teach our kids not to be mean",
"we tolerate noise and mess and junk food, but not meanness",
"startups are very counterintuitive",
"i'm not sure why",
"maybe it's just because knowledge about them hasn't permeated our culture yet",
"but whatever the reason, starting a startup is a task where you can't always trust your instincts",
"it's like skiing in that way",
"when you first try skiing and you want to slow down, your instinct is to lean back",
"but if you lean back on skis you fly down the hill out of control",
"so part of learning to ski is learning to suppress that impulse",
"eventually you get new habits, but at first it takes a conscious effort",
"at first there's a list of things you're trying to remember as you start down the hill",
"startups are as unnatural as skiing, so there's a similar list for startups",
"counterintuitive",
"if you know nothing more than this, you may at least pause before making them",
"it's really true",
"they seem wrong",
"so of course your first impulse is to disregard them",
"if founders' instincts already gave them the right answers, they wouldn't need us",
"you only need other people to give you advice that surprises you",
"that's why there are a lot of ski instructors and not many running instructors",
"you can, however, trust your instincts about people",
"and in fact one of the most common mistakes young founders make is not to do that enough",
"if someone seems slippery, or bogus, or a jerk, don't ignore it",
"this is one case where it pays to be self-indulgent",
"work with people you genuinely like, and you've known long enough to be sure",
"the second counterintuitive point is that it's not that important to know a lot about startups",
"mark zuckerberg didn't succeed because he was an expert on startups",
"if you don't know anything about, say, how to raise an angel round, don't feel bad on that account",
"that sort of thing you can learn when you need to, and forget after you've done it",
"\" it would set off alarms",

"eventually i realized why it was happening",
"think about what you have to do to get into college, for example",
"extracurricular activities, check",
"even in college classes most of the work is as artificial as running laps",
"i'm not attacking the educational system for being this way",
"i confess i did it myself in college",
"it was like a game",
"then they want to know what the tricks are for growing fast",
"and we have to tell them the best way to do that is simply to make something people want",

"the dangerous thing is, faking does work to some degree on investors",

"how do you win in each type of work, and what would you like to win by doing? [4]",
"all-consuming",
"that brings us to our fourth counterintuitive point: startups are all-consuming",
"if you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree you cannot imagine",
"so there is a real opportunity cost here",
"larry page may seem to have an enviable life, but there are aspects of it that are unenviable",
"if he goes on vacation for even a week, a whole week's backlog of shit accumulates",
"it never gets any easier",
"the nature of the problems change",
"but the total volume of worry never decreases; if anything it increases",
"many of which will make you a better parent when you do have kids",
"and since you can delay pushing the button for a while, most people in rich countries do",
"to be fair, the universities have their hand forced here",
"a lot of incoming students are interested in startups",
"universities are, at least de facto, expected to prepare them for their careers",
"so students who want to start startups hope universities can teach them about startups",
"can universities teach students about startups? yes and no",
"[5] so starting a startup is intrinsically something you can only really learn by doing it",
"you may be nominally a student for a bit, but you won't even be that for long",
"do not start a startup in college",

"if i haven't, let me try again: starting a startup is really hard",
"what if it's too hard? how can you tell if you're up to this challenge?",
"the answer is the fifth counterintuitive point: you can't tell",
"starting a startup will change you a lot",
"it was easy to tell how smart they were, and most people reading this will be over that threshold",
"the hard part was predicting how tough and ambitious they would become",
"the founders sometimes think they know",
"if you're absolutely terrified of starting a startup, you probably shouldn't do it",
"but if you're merely unsure whether you're up to it, the only way to find out is to try",

"in fact, so unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that they're startup ideas",
"this is not only possible, it's how apple, yahoo, google, and facebook all got started",
"none of these companies were even meant to be companies at first",
"they were all just side projects",
"the third part, incidentally, is how you get cofounders at the same time as the idea",
"\" but that prescription, though sufficient, is too narrow",
"what was special about brian chesky and joe gebbia was not that they were experts in technology",

"y combinator itself was something i only did because it seemed interesting",

"most startups that raise money do it more than once",
"reality can be messier",
"some companies raise money twice in phase 2",
"others skip phase 1 and go straight to phase 2",
"but the three phase path is at least the one about which individual startups' paths oscillate",

"you can't trust your intuitions",
"i'm going to give you a set of rules here that will get you through this process if anything will",
"at certain moments you'll be tempted to ignore them",
"so rule number zero is: these rules exist for a reason",
"the ultimate source of the forces acting on you are the forces acting on investors",
"but that fast growth means investors can't wait around",
"if you wait till a startup is obviously a success, it's too late",
"but that in turn makes investors nervous they're about to invest in a flop",
"as indeed they often are",
"what investors would like to do, if they could, is wait",
"but if you wait too long, other investors might take the deal away from you",
"and of course the other investors are all subject to the same forces",
"don't raise money unless you want it and it wants you",
"actually it isn't",

"one of the things that surprises founders most about fundraising is how distracting it is",
"when you start fundraising, everything else grinds to a halt",
"the problem is not the time fundraising consumes but that it becomes the top idea in your mind",
"a startup can't endure that level of distraction for long",
"because fundraising is so distracting, a startup should either be in fundraising mode or not",
"you can take money from investors when you're not in fundraising mode",
"you just can't expend any attention on it",
"there are two things that take attention: convincing investors, and negotiating with them",
"[3] the terms will be whatever they turn out to be in your next equity round",

"if they even say no",
"some of the worse ones never actually do say no; they just stop replying to your emails",
"they hope that way to get a free option on investing",
"that's not the worst thing investors will do",

"once you start getting investors to commit, it becomes increasingly easy to get more to",
"but the other side of this coin is that it's often hard to get the first commitment",
"getting the first substantial offer can be half the total difficulty of fundraising",
"what counts as a substantial offer depends on who it's from and how much it is",
"money from friends and family doesn't usually count, no matter how much",

"if you have additional expenses, like manufacturing, add in those at the end",
"underestimate how much you want",
"then when you reach $150k you're more than half done",
"whereas if you'd said you were raising $500k, you'd be less than a third done at $150k",

"founders who raise money at high valuations tend to be unduly proud of it",
"this is stupid, because fundraising is not the test that matters",

"don't reject an acceptable offer in the hope of getting a better one in the future",
"these simple rules cover a wide variety of cases",

"they're not necessarily trying to mislead you",
"most investors are genuinely unclear in their own minds why they like or dislike startups",
"if you seem like a winner, they'll like your idea more",
"but don't be too smug about this weakness of theirs, because you have it too; almost everyone does",
"there is a role for ideas of course",

"what they should not do is try to imitate the swagger of more experienced founders",
"investors are not always that good at judging technology, but they're good at judging confidence",
"if you try to act like something you're not, you'll just end up in an uncanny valley",
"you'll depart from sincere, but never arrive at convincing",
"the way to seem most formidable as an inexperienced founder is to stick to the truth",
"how formidable you seem isn't a constant",
"it varies depending on what you're saying",
"that's the secret",
"and by convince yourself, i don't mean play mind games with yourself to boost your confidence",
"i mean truly evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in",
"if it isn't, don't try to raise money",
"to evaluate whether your startup is worth investing in, you have to be a domain expert",
"which in fact it will usually be",
"know everything about your market",
"when the unfortunate fellow got to his last slide, the professor burst out:",
"which one of these conclusions do you actually believe?",
"even if you have no ideas",
"you have to produce something",
"and all too many startups go into fundraising in the same spirit",
"it's when you can convince investors, and not before",
"if you try convincing investors before you've convinced yourself, you'll be wasting both your time",
"but pausing first to convince yourself will do more than save you from wasting your time",
"it will force you to organize your thoughts",
"and if you can do that you'll end up with more than added confidence",
"you'll also have a provisional roadmap of how to succeed",
"no one knows whether a startup is going to succeed",
"startup investors know that every investment is a bet, and against pretty long odds",
"founders think of startups as ideas, but investors think of them as markets",
"your target market has to be big, and it also has to be capturable by you",
"but the market doesn't have to be big yet, nor do you necessarily have to be in it yet",
"the standard of plausibility varies dramatically depending on the age of the startup",
"microsoft for example was not going to grow huge selling basic interpreters",
"good, but not great",
"no company, however successful, ever looks more than a pretty good bet a few months in",
"microcomputers turned out to be a big deal, and microsoft both executed well and got lucky",
"but it was by no means obvious that this was how things would play out",
"plenty of companies seem as good a bet a few months in",
"and who can reasonably expect more of a startup than that?",
"if you can make as good a case as microsoft could have, will you convince investors? not always",
"a lot of vcs would have rejected microsoft",
"[9] certainly some rejected google",
"this is arguably a permissible tactic",
"it's arguably an instance of scamming a scammer",
"if you know you're on the right track, then you also know why investors were wrong to reject you",
"experienced investors are well aware that the best ideas are also the scariest",

"one of the most common types of advice we give at y combinator is to do things that don't scale",
"a lot of would-be founders believe that startups either take off or don't",
"or they don't, in which case the market must not exist",
"actually startups take off because the founders make them take off",
"a good metaphor would be the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters",
"the most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually",
"nearly all startups have to",
"you can't wait for users to come to you",
"you have to go out and get them",
"if anyone could have sat back and waited for users, it was stripe",
"but in fact they're famous within yc for aggressive early user acquisition",
"at yc we use the term \"collison installation\" for the technique they invented",
"\" but the collison brothers weren't going to wait",
"there are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users individually",
"one is a combination of shyness and laziness",
"the other reason founders ignore this path is that the absolute numbers seem so small at first",
"this can't be how the big, famous startups got started, they think",
"the mistake they make is to underestimate the power of compound growth",
"we encourage every startup to measure their progress by weekly growth rate",
"if you have 100 users, you need to get 10 more next week to grow 10% a week",
"after a year you'll have 14,000 users, and after 2 years you'll have 2 million",
"airbnb is a classic example of this technique",
"marketplaces are so hard to get rolling that you should expect to take heroic measures at first",
"that initial fragility was not a unique feature of airbnb",
"almost all startups are fragile initially",
"they unconsciously judge larval startups by the standards of established ones",
"it's harmless if reporters and know-it-alls dismiss your startup",
"they always get things wrong",
"it's even ok if investors dismiss your startup; they'll change their minds when they see growth",
"the big danger is that you'll dismiss your startup yourself",
"i've seen it happen",
"i often have to encourage founders who don't see the full potential of what they're building",
"even bill gates made that mistake",
"he returned to harvard for the fall semester after starting microsoft",
"they were just trying to survive",
"but in retrospect that too was the optimal path to dominating a big market",
"otherwise you'll have to make a more deliberate effort to locate the most promising vein of users",
"you should take extraordinary measures not just to acquire users, but also to make them happy",
"your first users should feel that signing up with you was one of the best choices they ever made",
"and you in turn should be racking your brains to think of new ways to delight them",
"you can be ornery when you're scotty, but not when you're kirk",
"that would be a great problem to have",
"see if you can make it happen",
"tim cook doesn't send you a hand-written note after you buy a laptop",
"but you can",
"that's one advantage of being small: you can provide a level of service no big company can",
"steve wasn't just using \"insanely\" as a synonym for \"very",
"what novice founders don't get is what insanely great translates to in a larval startup",
"when steve jobs started using that phrase, apple was already an established company",
"that's not hard for engineers to grasp",
"it's just a more extreme version of designing a robust and elegant product",
"it's not the product that should be insanely great, but the experience of being your user",
"the product is just one component of that",
"for a big company it's necessarily the dominant one",
"can, perhaps, but should? yes",
"over-engaging with early users is not just a permissible technique for getting growth rolling",
"making a better mousetrap is not an atomic operation",
"the feedback you get from engaging directly with your earliest users will be the best you ever get",
"sometimes the right unscalable trick is to focus on a deliberately narrow market",
"it's like keeping a fire contained at first to get it really hot before adding more logs",
"that's what facebook did",
"at first it was just for harvard students",
"most startups that use the contained fire strategy do it unconsciously",
"the strategy works just as well if you do it unconsciously",
"among companies, the best early adopters are usually other startups",
"plus when they succeed they grow fast, and you with them",
"they got started by doing something that really doesn't scale: assembling their routers themselves",
"hardware startups face an obstacle that software startups don't",
"the minimum order for a factory production run is usually several hundred thousand dollars",
"the arrival of crowdfunding (or more precisely, preorders) has helped a lot",
"but even so i'd advise startups to pull a meraki initially if they can",
"that's what pebble did",
"the pebbles assembled the first several hundred watches themselves",
"\" who knew?",
"even if there aren't many of them, there are probably adjacent territories that have more",
"consulting is the canonical example of work that doesn't scale",
"that's where companies cross the line",
"we did that at viaweb",
"since we would do anything to get users, we did",
"we felt pretty lame at the time",
"there's a more extreme variant where you don't just use your software, but are your software",
"some startups could be entirely manual at first",
"i should mention one sort of initial tactic that usually doesn't work: the big launch",
"they want to launch simultaneously in 8 different publications, with embargoes",
"and on a tuesday, of course, since they read somewhere that's the optimum day to launch something",
"it's easy to see how little launches matter",
"think of some successful startups",
"so why do founders think launches matter? a combination of solipsism and laziness",
"partnerships too usually don't work",
"it's not enough just to do something extraordinary initially",
"you have to make an extraordinary effort initially",
"y combinator has now funded 564 startups including the current batch, which has 53",
"7 billion, and the 511 prior to the current batch have collectively raised about $1",
"as usual those numbers are dominated by a few big winners",
"the top 10 startups account for 8",
"6 of that 11",
"but there is a peloton of younger startups behind them",
"there are about 40 more that have a shot at being really big",
"i'd guess we can grow another 2 or 3x before hitting the next bottleneck",
"one consequence of funding such a large number of startups is that we see trends early",
"i'm going to take a shot at describing where these trends are leading",
"i think more",
"now there's a third: start your own company",
"that's a big change",
"i think we're still at the beginning of this one",
"it's hard to predict how big a deal it will be",
"as big a deal as the industrial revolution? maybe",
"probably not",
"one thing we can say for sure is that there will be a lot more startups",
"this process is not just something happening now in silicon valley",
"it started decades ago, and it's happening as far afield as the car industry",
"it has a long way to run",
"the other big driver of change is that startups are becoming cheaper to start",
"which means investors will get less stock and less control",
"there are still a lot of people who'd make great founders who never end up starting a company",
"you can see that from how randomly some of the most successful startups got started",
"there might be 10x or even 50x more good founders out there",
"high returns don't come from investing at low valuations",
"they come from investing in the companies that do really well",
"so if there are more of those to be had each year, the best pickers should have more hits",
"this means there should be more variability in the vc business",
"whereas the bad firms will get the leftovers, as they do now, and yet pay a higher price for them",
"nor do i think it will be a problem that founders keep control of their companies for longer",
"what about angels? i think there is a lot of opportunity there",
"it used to suck to be an angel investor",
"and the days when vcs could wash angels out of the cap table are long gone",
"few investors understand the cost that raising money from them imposes on startups",
"and in this context, low-cost means deciding quickly",
"one is that the scariness of starting a startup in the old days was a pretty effective filter",
"now that the cost of failing is becoming lower, we should expect founders to do it more",
"that's not a bad thing",
"it will be interesting, in a bad way, if idea clashes become a lot more common",
"what used to be an obelisk will become a pyramid",
"it will be a little wider at the top, but a lot wider at the bottom",
"imagine the obelisk of investors that corresponds to the obelisk of startups",
"i think the biggest danger for vcs, and also the biggest opportunity, is at the series a stage",
"right now, vcs often knowingly invest too much money at the series a stage",
"some vcs lie and claim the company really needs that much",
"like a lot of bad things, this didn't happen intentionally",
"the vc business backed into it as their initial assumptions gradually became obsolete",

"venture capital is a business where occasional big successes generate hundredfold returns",
"if you want to find new opportunities for investing, look for things founders complain about",
"founders are your customers, and the things they complain about are unsatisfied demand",
"but the more general recipe is: do something founders want",
"the way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas",
"it's to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself",
"microsoft, apple, yahoo, google, and facebook all began this way",
"it sounds obvious to say you should only work on problems that exist",
"and yet by far the most common mistake startups make is to solve problems no one has",
"i made it myself",
"in 1995 i started a company to put art galleries online",
"but galleries didn't want to be online",
"it's not how the art business works",
"so why did i spend 6 months working on this stupid idea? because i didn't pay attention to users",
"i invented a model of the world that didn't correspond to reality, and worked from that",
"i didn't notice my model was wrong until i tried to convince users to pay for what we'd built",
"even then i took embarrassingly long to catch on",
"i was attached to my model of the world, and i'd spent a lot of time on the software",
"they had to want it",
"at yc we call these \"made-up\" or \"sitcom\" startup ideas",
"imagine one of the characters on a tv show was starting a startup",
"the writers would have to invent something for it to do",
"but coming up with good startup ideas is hard",
"it's not something you can do for the asking",
"for example, a social network for pet owners",
"it doesn't sound obviously mistaken",
"millions of people have pets",
"often they care a lot about their pets and spend a lot of money on them",
"surely many of these people would like a site where they could talk to other pet owners",
"you could serve them targeted offers, and maybe charge for premium features",
"\" they say \"yeah, maybe i could see using something like that",
"\" even when the startup launches, it will sound plausible to a lot of people",
"sum that reaction across the entire population, and you have zero users",
"choose the latter",
"if you invert the scale on the y axis, you can envision companies as holes",
"google is an immense crater: hundreds of millions of people use it, and they need it a lot",
"a startup just starting out can't expect to excavate that much volume",
"so you have two choices about the shape of hole you start with",
"you can either dig a hole that's broad but shallow, or one that's narrow and deep, like a well",
"made-up startup ideas are usually of the first type",
"lots of people are mildly interested in a social network for pet owners",
"nearly all good startup ideas are of the second type",
"microsoft was a well when they made altair basic",
"thirty years later facebook had the same shape",
"you don't need the narrowness of the well per se",
"it's depth you need; you get narrowness as a byproduct of optimizing for depth (and speed)",
"but you almost always do get it",
"facebook was a good idea because it started with a small market there was a fast path out of",
"so you spread rapidly through all the colleges",
"once you have all the college students, you get everyone else simply by letting them in",
"the founders of airbnb didn't realize at first how big a market they were tapping",
"initially they had a much narrower idea",
"they were going to let hosts rent out space on their floors during conventions",
"they didn't foresee the expansion of this idea; it forced itself upon them gradually",
"all they knew at first is that they were onto something",
"that's probably as much as bill gates or mark zuckerberg knew at first",
"occasionally it's obvious from the beginning when there's a path out of the initial niche",
"and sometimes i can see a path that's not immediately obvious; that's one of our specialties at yc",
"but there are limits to how well this can be done, no matter how much experience you have",
"in zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance, robert pirsig says:",

"make yourself perfect and then just paint naturally",
"i've wondered about that passage since i read it in high school",
"i'm not sure how useful his advice is for painting specifically, but it fits this situation well",
"empirically, the way to have good startup ideas is to become the sort of person who has them",
"you can also be at the leading edge as a user",
"but mark already lived online; to him it seemed natural",
"paul buchheit says that people at the leading edge of a rapidly changing field \"live in the future",
"\" combine that with pirsig and you get:",
"live in the future, then build what's missing",
"that describes the way many if not most of the biggest startups got started",
"neither apple nor yahoo nor google nor facebook were even supposed to be companies at first",
"they grew out of things their founders built because there seemed a gap in the world",
"\" lots of people heard about the altair",
"lots forgot usb sticks",
"the verb you want to be using with respect to startup ideas is not \"think up\" but \"notice",
"the most successful startups almost all begin this way",
"that may not have been what you wanted to hear",
"but disappointing though it may be, this is the truth",
"and it is a recipe of a sort, just one that in the worst case takes a year rather than a weekend",
"if you're not at the leading edge of some rapidly changing field, you can get to one",
"for example, anyone reasonably smart can probably get to an edge of programming (e",
"building mobile apps) in a year",
"especially if you're also looking for a cofounder",
"you don't have to learn programming to be at the leading edge of a domain that's changing fast",
"other domains change fast",
"but while learning to hack is not necessary, it is for the forseeable future sufficient",
"as marc andreessen put it, software is eating the world, and this trend has decades left to run",
"knowing how to hack also means that when you have ideas, you'll be able to implement them",
"that's not absolutely necessary (jeff bezos couldn't) but it's an advantage",
"i'll try building an initial version tonight",
"what won't be obvious is that they're startup ideas",
"most things that are missing will take some time to see",

"this is not one of those problems where there might not be an answer",
"it's impossibly unlikely that this is the exact moment when technological progress stops",
"and when these problems get solved, they will probably seem flamingly obvious in retrospect",

"\" backrub seemed like an inconsequential science project",
"the facebook was just a way for undergrads to stalk one another",
"to us that's positive evidence an idea is good",
"live in the future and build what seems interesting",
"that's what i'd advise college students to do, rather than trying to learn about \"entrepreneurship",
"\" \"entrepreneurship\" is something you learn best by doing it",
"the examples of the most successful founders make that clear",

"college is an incomparable opportunity to do that",

"the clash of domains is a particularly fruitful source of ideas",
"or better still, go work for a biotech company",
"cs majors normally get summer jobs at computer hardware or software companies",

"the question then is whether that beachhead is big enough",
"err on the side of doing things where you'll face competitors",
"inexperienced founders usually give competitors more credit than they deserve",
"whether you succeed depends far more on you than on your competitors",

"in fact that's a very promising starting point",
"google was that type of idea",
"your thesis has to be more precise than \"we're going to make an x that doesn't suck\" though",
"you have to be able to phrase it in terms of something the incumbents are overlooking",
"google was that type of idea too",
"they'd prefer not to deal with tedious problems or get involved in messy ways with the real world",
"which is a reasonable preference, because such things slow you down",
"and dealing with payments is a schlep for stripe, but not an intolerable one",

"it's hard to make ourselves take enough risks",
"when you interview a startup and think \"they seem likely to succeed,\" it's hard not to fund them",
"their chances of succeeding seem small",
"unfortunately picking winners is harder than that",
"that's made harder by the fact that the best startup ideas seem at first like bad ideas",
"so the most successful founders tend to work on ideas that few beside them realize are good",

"it takes a conscious effort not to do that too",
"but those are the wrong eyes to look through",
"we can afford to take at least 10x as much risk as demo day investors",
"and since risk is usually proportionate to reward, if you can afford to take more risk you should",
"i don't know what fraction of them currently raise more after demo day",
"[5] but the percentage is certainly way over 30%",

"a demo day where only 30% of the startups were fundable would be a shambles",
"everyone would agree that yc had jumped the shark",

"but here again there's a tradeoff between smoothness and ideas",
"all the time you spend practicing a talk, you could instead spend making it better",
"but i always end up spending most of the time rewriting it instead",
"every talk i give ends up being given from a manuscript full of things crossed out and rewritten",
"depending on your audience, there are even worse tradeoffs than these",
"that's true in writing too of course, but the descent is steeper with talks",
"any given person is dumber as a member of an audience than as a reader",
"every audience is an incipient mob, and a good speaker uses that",
"so are talks useless? they're certainly inferior to the written word as a source of ideas",
"but that's not all talks are good for",
"when i go to a talk, it's usually because i'm interested in the speaker",
"talks are also good at motivating me to do things",
"it's probably no coincidence that so many famous speakers are described as motivational speakers",

"the reason it seems ridiculous to us to treat smells as property is that it wouldn't work to",

"but the most immediate evidence i had that something was amiss was that i couldn't talk to them",
"there are great startup ideas lying around unexploited right under our noses",
"one reason we don't see them is a phenomenon i call schlep blindness",

"no one likes schleps, but hackers especially dislike them",
"maybe that's possible, but i haven't seen it",

"no, you can't start a startup by just writing code",
"i remember going through this realization myself",
"a company is defined by the schleps it will undertake",
"and schleps should be dealt with the same way you'd deal with a cold swimming pool: just jump in",
"the most dangerous thing about our dislike of schleps is that much of it is unconscious",
"your unconscious won't even let you see ideas that involve painful schleps",
"that's schlep blindness",

"even the most willful people are susceptible to it",
"he responded so eagerly that for about half a second i found myself considering doing it",
"in most other cities, the prospect of starting a startup just doesn't seem real",
"in the valley it's not only real but fashionable",
"that no doubt causes a lot of people to start startups who shouldn't",
"but i think that's ok",
"the second component of the antidote is chance meetings with people who can help you",
"the reason startups are more likely to make it here is that great things happen to them too",
"in the valley, lightning has a sign bit",
"and moreover has advanced views, for 2004, on founders retaining control of their companies",
"you can't say precisely what the miracle will be, or even for sure that one will happen",
"i bet this is true even for startups we fund",
"chance meetings play a role like the role relaxation plays in having ideas",
"the critical thing in both cases is that they drift just the right amount",
"the meeting between larry page and sergey brin was a good example",
"for larry page the most important component of the antidote was sergey brin, and vice versa",
"the antidote is people",
"i'm not sure why this is so",
"a large part of yc's function is to accelerate that process",
"to make a startup hub, you need a lot of people interested in startups",
"there are three reasons",

"sean parker was exactly what facebook needed in 2004",
"this is one of the reasons we fund such a large number of companies, incidentally",
"in most places the atmosphere pulls you back toward the mean",
