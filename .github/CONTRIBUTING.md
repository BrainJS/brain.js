# Contribution Steps:

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to brain.js. Follow these guidelines to make the process smoother:

1. Clone `master` branch

2.  One feature per pull request. Each PR should have one focus, and all the code changes should be supporting that one feature or bug fix. Using a [separate branch](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for each feature should help you manage developing multiple features at once.

3.  Add/update a test for the feature or fix, if possible. To run these tests:

```bash
npm run test # run tests
```

# Notes: 
- This repository uses `.editorconfig`, `eslint` (`airbnb`) and `prettier` for linting and formating to make coding style consistent throughout the repository, which will automatically run on git `commit`. 

- Please do not run build/dist script and do not bump version number for the script. These things will be handled by the maintainers when necessary.
